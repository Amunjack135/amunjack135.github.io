        <h1>My Bio</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Amun Jackson. I am a Junior Computer Science student from Charlotte, NC. I decided to pursue Computer Science because computers and math intrigued me as a child. Some of my hobbies include going to the gym, reading thriller books, comic books, and self-care books. I also enjoy watching TV, anime, and movies. My favorite TV shows are Breaking Bad and The Sopranos, and my favorite anime includes Naruto, Attack on Titan, and Code Geass. One of my favorite movies is Shutter Island. Iâ€™m also a huge sports fan, and my favorite team is the Atlanta Falcons. Nice to meet you!
